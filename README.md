# FaceTheMusic
Python based opencv program for linux which watches people watching youtube

@description: Currently a game. Points are accrued the longer users are watching the screen.
Points are reset if nobody is watching the screen and the video is changed if noone watches long enough.

@require: python2, opencv2, youtube-viewer and a webcam.

@todo: Add sentiment analysis, track multiple facial characteristics, add database tracking timestamped video total scores
